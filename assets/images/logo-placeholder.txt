Logo Placeholder for Dark Mode Theme

For the Mita Studio logo, consider creating a modern, clean design that represents:
1. AI/LLM technology
2. Customization/plugins
3. Chat/communication

Suggested colors (optimized for dark mode):
- Primary: #4a86e8 (blue)
- Secondary: #6c5ce7 (purple)
- Accent: #00cec9 (teal)
- Background: Dark (#121212 or #1e1e1e)
- Text/Details: Light (#e1e1e1 or #f5f5f5)

Design considerations for dark mode:
- Use glowing effects for better visibility against dark backgrounds
- Consider using gradients for a modern look
- Ensure high contrast for better visibility
- Possibly include subtle particle or circuit-like elements to represent AI

Recommended dimensions:
- 512x512px for the main logo
- 192x192px for PWA icon
- 32x32px and 16x16px for favicon versions

You can create a logo using tools like:
- Adobe Illustrator
- Figma
- Canva
- Looka.com
- Brandmark.io

Once created, save the logo as:
- logo.png (main logo)
- favicon.png (for the browser tab icon)

Place these files in this directory (assets/images/).

For a quick placeholder, you could use a simple icon with the letter "M" in a geometric shape with a gradient of the brand colors and a subtle glow effect.
